# Classy-PhD-thesis-template

Preview of the template can be found [**here**](https://andywiecko.github.io/assets/phd_thesis.pdf).

**Warning:** project is quite heavy â€” it is recomended to complie it locally, using *Overleaf* could be overkill until one remove `Tikz` code, included pdf, and/or hypperrefs.

## TODO

- Make list of included features with preview (in the `README.md` file)
- Remove original text and replace it with some dummy lorem ipsum text, and fake bib, etc.
